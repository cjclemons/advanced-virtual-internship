            Can’t Hurt Me is a memoir written by retired Navy SEAL David
            Goggins, detailing his journey from a troubled childhood to becoming
            one of the toughest endurance athletes in the world. The book is
            split into two parts: the first part focuses on Goggins’ childhood
            and early adult life, while the second part delves into his military
            training and athletic accomplishments. Part One: Childhood and Early
            Adulthood Goggins was born into poverty in rural Indiana, and his
            childhood was marked by abuse and neglect from his father, who was
            an alcoholic. Goggins and his mother were regularly beaten by his
            father, and he had to endure racial discrimination due to his
            mixed-race heritage. Goggins’ childhood was further complicated by a
            learning disability that made it difficult for him to read and
            write, which contributed to his poor academic performance and low
            self-esteem. Despite his difficult upbringing, Goggins was
            determined to make something of himself. He joined the Air Force
            after high school, but was discharged after just a few years due to
            a medical condition. After leaving the Air Force, Goggins worked as
            an exterminator and a factory worker before deciding to pursue a
            career as a Navy SEAL. Goggins faced many obstacles in his journey
            to become a Navy SEAL. He struggled with obesity and had to lose
            over 100 pounds in order to meet the physical requirements for SEAL
            training. He also had to overcome a fear of water and learn to swim,
            which was a significant challenge for him due to his upbringing in a
            landlocked state. Part Two: Military Training and Athletic
            Accomplishments Goggins’ military career began when he joined the
            Air Force Security Forces, where he learned the skills that would
            eventually make him an effective SEAL. After several attempts,
            Goggins finally made it through Navy SEAL training and was deployed
            to Iraq and Afghanistan. Goggins’ time in the military was marked by
            numerous injuries and close calls, including a helicopter crash that
            left him with a broken back. Despite these setbacks, Goggins
            continued to push himself physically and mentally, and he became
            known as one of the toughest SEALs in the unit. After leaving the
            military, Goggins turned his attention to endurance sports, setting
            records in events such as the Badwater Ultramarathon and the World’s
            Toughest Mudder. Goggins’ athletic accomplishments are impressive,
            but what sets him apart is his mental toughness and willingness to
            push himself beyond what most people would consider possible. Key
            Themes Can’t Hurt Me is a powerful story of resilience and
            determination, and it contains several key themes that are relevant
            to anyone looking to achieve their goals. The first theme is the
            importance of self-talk. Goggins believes that the way we talk to
            ourselves can either limit or expand our potential. He emphasizes
            the need to identify and overcome negative self-talk, which he
            refers to as the “voice of doubt.” By changing the way we talk to
            ourselves, Goggins believes we can unlock our full potential and
            achieve our goals. The second theme is the importance of pushing
            ourselves outside of our comfort zones. Goggins believes that growth
            and improvement only happen when we challenge ourselves, and he
            encourages readers to embrace discomfort and adversity as
            opportunities for growth. Finally, Can’t Hurt Me emphasizes the
            importance of taking ownership of our lives. Goggins believes that
            we are all responsible for our own success and happiness, and that
            we have the power to overcome even the most challenging
            circumstances if we are willing to put in the work. Conclusion Can’t
            Hurt Me is an inspiring and powerful memoir that offers valuable
            insights into the mindset and strategies of one of the toughest
            endurance athletes in the world. Goggins’ story is a testament to
            the power of perseverance and resilience, and his experiences offer
            valuable lessons for anyone who is looking to push beyond their own
            limits and achieve their goals. One of the key takeaways from Can’t
            Hurt Me is the importance of mindset. Goggins believes that our
            mindset determines our ability to achieve our goals, and he
            encourages readers to cultivate a mindset of resilience and
            determination. This means learning to embrace discomfort and
            adversity, and refusing to give up even when the going gets tough.
            Another important lesson from the book is the importance of
            self-discipline. Goggins believes that self-discipline is the
            foundation of success, and he encourages readers to develop a daily
            practice of pushing themselves outside of their comfort zones. This
            means setting goals and taking small, incremental steps towards
            achieving them, even when it feels uncomfortable or difficult.
            Throughout the book, Goggins also emphasizes the importance of
            taking responsibility for our own lives. He believes that we are all
            responsible for our own success and happiness, and that we have the
            power to create the lives we want if we are willing to put in the
            work. This means taking ownership of our own failures and
            shortcomings, and using them as opportunities for growth and
            self-improvement. Overall, Can’t Hurt Me is a powerful and inspiring
            book that offers valuable insights into the mindset and strategies
            of one of the toughest endurance athletes in the world. Through his
            own experiences and struggles, Goggins demonstrates the power of
            perseverance, resilience, and self-discipline, and offers valuable
            lessons for anyone looking to push beyond their own limits and
            achieve their goals.
